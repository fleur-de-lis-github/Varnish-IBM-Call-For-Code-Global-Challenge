## Challenge Overview

Call for Code aims to tackle the imminent and existential threat to Planet Earth: climate change. As the United Nations describes, “The impacts of climate change are global in scope and unprecedented in scale. Without drastic action today, adapting to these impacts in the future will be more difficult and costly.” The level of urgency surrounding the threats of climate change require immediate action, and Call for Code is arming its growing community of 400,000 developers and problem solvers across 179 nations with the tools to build tech solutions that can fight back.
